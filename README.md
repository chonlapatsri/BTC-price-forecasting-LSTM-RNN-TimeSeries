# BTC-price-forecasting-LSTM-RNN-TimeSeries
Using an LSTM Recurrent Neural Network to predict the price of BTC. The dataset is a multivariate time series available via this link: https://rb.gy/w75tk.

The model was developed using PyTorch APIs and auto hyperparameter tuning with Hyperopt. Early stopping of both RNN and hyperparameter tuning loops were utilised.
